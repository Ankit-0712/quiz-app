# Quiz App

This is a React-based quiz application with gamification features. The quiz fetches data from an API using a proxy server to handle CORS issues.

## Features
- Interactive UI with animations (Framer Motion)
- Multiple-choice questions
- API-based quiz data retrieval
- Answer validation with instant feedback
- Progress tracking
- Responsive design

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quiz-app.git

## Running the App

### 1. Start the Proxy Server
Before running the React app, start the proxy server (`proxy.js`) to avoid CORS issues:
```sh
node proxy.js
```
This will start the proxy server on port `5000`.

### 2. Run the React App
```sh
npm start
```
This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser.

## Proxy Setup
A `proxy.js` file is used to fetch API data while avoiding CORS issues. The React app makes requests to `http://localhost:5000`, which the proxy forwards to the actual API.



### How It Works:
- The React app makes requests to `http://localhost:5000/api/...`
- The proxy forwards the request to `https://actual-api.com/...`
- This bypasses CORS restrictions
